This is a web app I created to store and display my personal collection of literature and academic works, the 
academic works are mostly Philosophy, Theology, Philology, and Psycology.

** FUNCTIONALITY **

    I have a list of all books in the database in the store page, these books can be viewed
    by catagory and they can also be searched for by author or title

    I also have a favorites page that acts like a cart, just storing the favorited books of whatever
    user is connected
